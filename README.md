# **Classic Tic-Tac-Toe Game.**

This a recreation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe using Ruby. The project is meant to reinforce Object Oriented Programing (OOP) concepts. You can learn more about the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe" target="_blank">**HERE.**</a>

## **How to play our game**

Our game is a command line game so you need to be in a terminal, or terminal like environment, to run it.

The game starts by taking in the names of 2 players and uses the first letter of their names as their player marker on the board. The board is a 3 X 3 grid and each player takes turn placing markers on the board, starting with the first player. The game ends if any player has a straight set of 3 characters horizontal, vertical or diagonal or if the board is full.
